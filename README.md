# mastermind

This is my attempt at a Mastermind game using Ruby
via the Odin Project Ruby Course!

It is one of my first bigger projects with Ruby and
I'm proud of what I have learned along the way.

Some of the things that I've learned:

- How to better compartmentalize different classes to
  makes things more modular and molecular
- How to set up a gemfile for my application
- How to use a ruby new ruby gem for my application (Colored2)


Things I need to improve on:

- Making methods even more molecular and not as dependent on other inputs/methods
- Shortening method definitions and conditional logic
- Creating a mile high view of the project from the onset
  (I spent a lot of time adding classes in different files and having to refactor
  the code many times because of this)


All in all, although this is far from perfect, I had a lot of fun doing
it and am proud of what I have accomplished.

Many thanks to stackoverflow and also to Chris Wanstrath & Konstantin Gredeskoul
for use of their open-source Colored2 Gem. (https://rubygems.org/gems/colored2/versions/3.1.2)

I hope to keep improving from here.
